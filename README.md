# Basic HashSet Implementation

This Python class provides a basic implementation for a HashSet. This class was based on code written in Java by my CSE 143 professor; I based my Python code on the Java code.


I would like to give credit to UW Seattle's autumn 2017 CSE 143 course for providing the basis for this code. The original code can be found on this page, on 12/6: [CSE 143](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/17au/calendar.shtml)
